                    Hello dev team &#128075, hope you guys are having a nice weekend. 
                    The wireframe is on its way, and in the meantime the dev team will continue practicing
                    HTML/CSS/Js/11ty. This time however, we will be doing prompts that are colser to the actual 
                    things that we will be doing for UXLA.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although we don't have the wireframe yet, we can expect some basic compoents almost every website has - 
                    namely, the homepage. We will focus on building a prototype homepage, with basic featurtes like           
                    navigation bars 
                </p>
 <div class = "divider"></div>
                <p>
                   This time, we will have two prompts, and you will assign yourself to one of them. 
                   I will send out a Google Sheet link in the groupchat, so make sure you indicate which 
                   prompt you are doing.
                </p>
            </div>
                <div class="container">

                <h2>Building the landing page</h2>

                <p>The formal term for the main page of a website is "landing page". 
                Landing pages are often the first thing someone sees when visiting the website, 
                so we want to make sure it's well made. Again, the two prompts will focus on building 
                a prototype landing page for UXLA.  
                </p>

                <div class="prompt">
                    <div>
                        <h4>Prompt #1</h4> 
                        <h2>The Main page</h2> 
                        <div class="difficulty">
                            <h4>Difficulty</h4>
                            <span style="background-color: rgb(38, 125, 255);"></span>

                    </div>
                   
                </div>

                <p>Update <span>index.html</span> to include the follwoing items:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Name of the website (UXLA)</li>
                    <li>Graphics that represrnt the website (stock image is fine for now)</li>
                    <li>Intro section to describe what the website is about</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition, create a CSS file called <span>style.css</span>
                and link it from <span>index.html</span>. Write CSS code to implement the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the website is displayed in the center of the screen, both vertically and horizontally</li>
                    <li>Texts in the intro section will have a width of 600px on desktop, and 90% on mobile</li>
                    <li>Texts use fonts adhereing to the ACM branding</li>
                </ul>


                <div class="prompt">
                    <div>
                        <h4>Prompt #2</h4> 
                        <h2>Navigation bar</h2> 
                        <div class="difficulty">
                            <h4>Difficulty</h4>
                            <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 197, 38);"></span>
                            <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 197, 38);"></span>
                            <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 197, 38);"></span>

                            <p>March 1<sup>st</sup>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                   
                </div>

                <p>Creates several dummy posts in the <span>posts</span> directory</p>
                <p>Create a file called<span>index2.html</span> and include the follwoing items:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A navigation bar with links to the posts</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Though it is possible to hard-code the links, for this prompt use <span>liquid</span>
                and <span>nunjucks</span>, which are speacial languages supported by 11ty that can automate this process.
                More specifically, you should write a for loop using these languages that can automatically retrieve the title and links to the posts, and 
                generate contents of the navigation bar</p>

                <div class = "note">
                    <span></span>
                    <div>
                        <p>If you have ben working on "Tier 2: 11ty and Nunjucks" from the previous assignment,
                            you can carry over your work to this prompt.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p></p>

            </div>
           
                <div class="container">

                <h2>The prompts look familiar...</h2>
                <p>Yes, yes they do. They are pretty much like the last one. However, this time I will be going through your submissions a 
                bit more rigourously and give feedback/advice based on what I see. So even if you have already done a simialr prompt from last week,
                try to brush up your code and improve upon it.</p>

                 </div>

<div class="container">
            <h2>Before you begin</h2>

            <p>Before you dive into coding, there are few things to note:</p>

            <div class = "warning">
                <div>
                    <p>Make sure you are in the <span>dev</span> branch when you code, add, commit, and push. 
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>To move into the dev branch, open your terminal at the UXLA directory and run the follwoing command:</p>

            <div class="code">
                <p><span class="blue">/UXLA/$</span> git checkout dev</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "divider"></div>

            <div class = "warning">
                <div>
                    <p>Beware of conflicts</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This prompt is rather unusual in that many people will be working on the same file at the same time.
                To make sure you don't accidentally overwrite other people's work, or vice versa, run 
                <span>git pull</span> frequently on your computer to ensure you have the latest version of the code. 
                Don't forget to communicate and coordinate with other members to update each other on what you are doing. 
            </p>

            <div class = "divider"></div>
            <div class = "warning">
                <div>

            <p>Web development is said to be relatively easy to learn - but it can be definately be difficult to <i>master</i>. 
            Along the way you will likely encounter problems and challenges. If that happens, don't hesitate to ask questions.
